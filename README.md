# mcmc-talk

Hello! This repository houses the materials for a presentation given to the [Murray Lab](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/murray/) on using Markov Chain Monte Carlo for fitting statistical models.

The slides are in the format of a Jupyter notebook written to be presentation-friendly. It can be found at `./mcmc-talk.ipynb` and may be updated from time to time. You are highly encouraged to follow along and experiment by running and modifying the Python code for yourself. The only required library is `bambi==0.7.1` (homepage [here](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/)); many other relevant libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `pymc3`, etc.) are pulled in as dependences.

A few supporting images were pulled from the internet or various texts. Wherever used in the notebook, attribution is given adjacent to the embedded images.

Please feel free to reach out to me with questions/follow-ups, or to access a recording of the original presentation!
